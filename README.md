# PasCAL
 Numerical Analysis Engine
 A tiny mumerical analysis toolkit for quick calculations. Since this runs in the browser to not consume too much power the upper limit for NMAX = 5000 and lower limit for TOL = 10e-10. 
 
 To use larger more complicated functions or more precise meaurements please use matlab or native/system programming languages.

 ## Formats

 Functions: Use appropriate parenthesis, almost everything else is good enough as long as it is made up basic functions like polynomials, trignometrix etc.

 Matrices: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]] is the identity matrix as an example for format. Avoid trailing commas.
 Another example is [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[,9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]] for a 4x4 or so on, 1x1 is also simply [[1]].
 Please use this format only to write matrices or let me know what other formats would you want, else it may not work.

 Tol: Can be any number as or exponential ex. 2, 3, 3.14, 10e-5 (Written normally as 10^-5) etc.

 NMax: Whole Number <5000

### Disclaimer

There may be errors in the program it has been written largely manually. If you find bugs please let me know about them, this not recommended for use on a test. Yet.

### Why The Name?

In honor of Blaise Pascal for inventing the world's first calculator

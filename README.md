 Too not consume too much power the upper limit for NMAX = 5000 and lower limit for TOL = 10e-10

 ## Formats

 Functions: Use appropriate parenthesis, almost everything else is good enough as long as it is made up basic functions like polynomials, trignometrix etc.

 Matrices: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]] is the identity matrix as an example for format. Avoid trailing commas

 Tol: Can be any number as or exponential ex. 2, 3, 3.14, 10e-5 (Written normally as 10^-5) etc.

 NMax: Whole Number <5000

### Disclaimer

There may be errors in the program it has been written largely manually. If you find bugs please report them, not recommended for use on a test.

### Why The Name?

In honor of Blaise Pascal for inventing the world's first calculator
